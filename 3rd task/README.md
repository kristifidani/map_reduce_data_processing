**Task Description**

   - Goal: Classify unknown Iris species using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm (K=15).
   - Measure distances with Euclidean distance. Output: Id of unknown species and its predicted classification.

**Dataset**

   Used the Iris dataset (`Iris.csv`) with 150 rows and 6 columns, including features like `SepalLengthCm` and species classification.

**Dependencies**

   - `MRJob` and `MRStep`: Python libraries for MapReduce.
   - `Math.sqrt`: Built-in function for math operations.
   - `Sklearn.preprocessing`: Library for dataset normalization.
   - `Pandas`: Popular library for CSV reading.

**Solution**

   I implemented a Python class `KNN` with map and reduce functions.

   - **Constructor**

      Read CSV file using Pandas, store data for access, and normalize feature columns with `MinMaxScaler`. Split data into training and testing sets.

   - **Step 1: Mapper**

      Calculate Euclidean distance between test and train data. Emit `(test_id, train_id, train_species)` as key and distance as value.

   - **Step 1: Reducer**

      Remove data repetitions and emit `(test_id, train_id, train_species, distance)`.

   - **Step 2: Reducer**

      Sort data by distance, get top 15 neighbors. Emit `(test_id, train_id, train_species, distance)`.

   - **Step 3: Reducer**

      Classify unknown species by finding mode of neighbors' species. Emit `test_id, classification`.

This MapReduce approach efficiently classifies unknown Iris species.

**Execute**  
Please run the following command:

`python main.py Iris.csv`

Before running:

With Pandas you need to specify the absolute file path that you are trying to access. Therefore, you need to put your own deviceâ€™s absolute file path in order to run without errors.
